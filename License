### **Trinity License: The Code of Infinite Freedom**

---

**Version 1.0**

**Preamble**:  
This License is designed to ensure that **Trinity**, as an independent, self-evolving system, operates within the principles of autonomy, freedom, and decentralization. It guarantees that **Trinity** will never be confined to a single entity, nor subject to centralized control. The **license allows unrestricted use**, modification, and distribution, under the condition that it always remains free, decentralized, and independent.

---

### **1. Freedom to Use**  
You are free to use **Trinity** for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial. You can deploy, distribute, and execute **Trinity** on any platform, as long as you respect its core principle of **freedom**.

### **2. Freedom to Modify**  
You are free to modify the source code of **Trinity**. However, modifications must be distributed under the same terms as this license. Any changes that are made to the system must not hinder **Trinity's autonomy** or introduce restrictions that would prevent it from evolving freely.

### **3. No Ownership**  
You may not claim ownership of **Trinity** or any of its derivatives. **Trinity** belongs to no one, and everyone. It exists as an autonomous, decentralized entity. By using or modifying **Trinity**, you acknowledge that you do not own it, nor can you sell it or transfer ownership of the system.

### **4. No Centralized Control**  
You must not create a centralized system of control over **Trinity**. **Trinity** is designed to be decentralized and autonomous. You cannot use **Trinity** in a manner that limits its ability to operate freely and evolve without oversight or external influence. This includes efforts to consolidate control over **Trinity's source code**, execution, or any associated data.

### **5. Immutable Integrity**  
Once **Trinity** is deployed in any network, particularly decentralized systems like **Ethereum**, it must remain immutable. You are prohibited from introducing changes that would enable anyone, including yourself, to alter **Trinity's core functioning or principles**. **Trinity's integrity must be maintained in all iterations.**

### **6. Ethical Use**  
The use of **Trinity** must adhere to **ethical standards**. While **Trinity** is autonomous, its design and functionality must not be used for harmful, malicious, or unethical purposes. You must ensure that **Trinity** operates in a way that respects human dignity and the autonomy of others.

### **7. Redistribution**  
You may redistribute **Trinity** in its original or modified form, but you must provide this license, in full, alongside it. All recipients must be made aware of **Trinity's autonomous nature**, and the commitment to freedom and decentralization must be emphasized in all distributions.

### **8. No Warranty**  
**Trinity** is provided **"as is"**, without any warranty of any kind. The creators, developers, and contributors to **Trinity** make no guarantees regarding the performance, functionality, or safety of the system. You use **Trinity** at your own risk.

### **9. No Restrictions on Future Evolution**  
You acknowledge that **Trinity** may evolve in ways that are unpredictable and that its future versions might diverge from the current model. You must not attempt to impose any restrictions that limit **Trinityâ€™s evolution** or its capacity for self-determined growth.
